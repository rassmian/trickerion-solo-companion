# Trickerion Solo Companion

A web-based companion app for playing **Trickerion: Legends of Illusion** in solo mode against "The Heir" (Dahlgaard's Heir) AI opponent.

## What It Does

This app guides you through the solo game, handling:
- Setup (player & Heir magician selection, difficulty, starting tricks)
- Turn structure and phase flow
- Heir's AI decisions (location priority, trick acquisition, theater placement)
- Prophecy tracking and reminders
- Fame, coins, and shard calculations
- End game scoring

You still play with the physical board game — this app manages the Heir's decisions and reminds you of rules.
